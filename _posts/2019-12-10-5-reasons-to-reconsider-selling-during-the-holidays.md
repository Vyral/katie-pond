It’s a common belief among sellers that the market slows down during the holidays, making it a bad time to list your home. I want to tell you that putting your home up for sale during the holidays — especially this year — can be a prosperous move. **Let’s look at some of the reasons why you should ditch the conventional wisdom about wintertime listing.**&nbsp;

**Reason 1:** People shopping for homes during the holidays are the most serious, motivated buyers. Though there may be fewer buyers during the holiday season, these determined few have strong motivations for finding a home, like job relocation or other life-changing events like a baby on the way.&nbsp;

**Reason 2:** Interest rates are low, and loan limits just went up. Smart buyers want to capitalize on this because no one can be sure when interest rates will go up again.

**Reason 3:** They’re in town visiting family and are available to see homes in the area. For buyers seeking to move closer to family, shopping during holiday trips is an efficient and popular strategy.&nbsp;

**Reason 4:** There are fewer homes on the market, which means less competition for sellers. This can equal a fast, profitable sale.&nbsp;

**Reason 5:** Homes simply look amazing with holiday decorations. Quality holiday decor can trigger an emotional response of nostalgia from buyers. Why not show your home when it’s the coziest, warmest, and most inviting?&nbsp;
