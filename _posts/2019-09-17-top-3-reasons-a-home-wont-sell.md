Listing your home on the market can be quite a stressful experience, but it will be even more so if no buyers turn up. What causes homes to sit on the market without any offers?&nbsp;

Actually, there are three main reasons a home might not sell, and we’ll go over each today:

**1\. Inadequate marketing and exposure.** With over 90% of today’s buyers beginning their home search online, it’s crucial for a listing to have a strong online presence. Having your agent stick a sign in your yard isn’t enough. Your home needs to be advertised across myriad platforms, both digital and nondigital, to attract buyers.

**2\. Inadequate staging.** If a home doesn’t look and feel great when a buyer sets foot inside, they won’t likely consider submitting an offer. You need to declutter, depersonalize, and stage your home if you want to spark buyers’ interest.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Poor pricing.** Homes that are priced too high will tend to sit on the market untouched for a long time before attracting any buyers, if they ever do at all. The best way to sell your home quickly and for top dollar is to price your home at, or even slightly below, market value. This will draw buyers in and could potentially drum up a bidding war.

If you have any other questions or would like more information about what to do (and what not to do) when selling a home, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
