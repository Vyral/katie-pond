Have you ever found yourself wondering how to spruce up your holiday table decor? Magazine spreads make it look easy, but without any direction, it often doesn’t feel so simple to put together something that will wow your friends and relatives.&nbsp;

That’s why, with the holiday season coming right up, I recently met with home design expert Hanine Smith of Beachy Boheme to discuss a few table decor tricks every host and hostess should know. Hanine was kind enough to demonstrate the art of table decorating for us during our discussion, so **follow along in the video above starting at 0:49 to see her work her design magic.&nbsp;**

As you watch, one thing you’ll notice is that Hanine stays true to the first piece of advice she offered during our interview, which is to keep the bulk of your table decor timeless while sprinkling in a few on-trend accents throughout. Hanine utilizes texture, color, dimension, and even scent to really make the table in today’s demonstration pop.&nbsp;

Hopefully, this inspires you to try your hand at giving your own holiday table a makeover.
