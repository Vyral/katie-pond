Today we want to tell you about how you can make you move a miracle. **Warning: We’re going to be discussing some sensitive material.&nbsp;**

There’s something incredibly alarming going on in our city and all across the world. Children are being enslaved and abused in a multi-billion dollar sex trafficking industry. We recently became aware of how heinous and rampant this problem is, and we were so anguished knowing children were being harmed in this way, that we resolved to do something about it.&nbsp;

So, we’ve committed to donate 10% of every transaction we do to Operation Underground Railroad. Every $3,400 donated helps save a child’s life. Operation Underground Railroad is a nonprofit made up of ex-CIA and military personnel devoted to stopping sex trafficking around the globe. I**n the five years they’ve been around they’ve saved over 2,500 children’s lives and assisted in the arrest 1,500 sex traffickers.&nbsp;**

This is not a problem happening somewhere else. San Diego consistently ranks as one of the top 10 cities in the United States for sex trafficking.&nbsp;

Our job is to assist families with one of the most thrilling times in life, when you're buying, selling a home, and moving. We wanted something positive to come out of those transactions to help families who are in the roughest times of their lives. We wanted our partnership with our home sellers and homebuyers to move on after that transaction to do something good in our community and do something good in the world, a ripple effect. **When you partner with the Pond Team for your real estate needs, you also help save the lives of children around the world and in our community.** Thank you\!
