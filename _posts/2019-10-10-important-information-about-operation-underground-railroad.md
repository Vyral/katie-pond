Today we want to take your attention away from real estate to focus on an organization that is close to our hearts. **Before we do, please be aware that we’re going to be discussing some sensitive material.&nbsp;**

This is a challenging subject to discuss, but an important one, too. There’s something incredibly alarming going on in our city and all across the world: Children are being enslaved and abused in a multi-billion dollar sex trafficking industry. After becoming aware of how prevalent this problem truly is, our team has resolved to do our part to help fight back against it.&nbsp;

We’ve committed to donate 10% of every transaction we do to Operation Underground Railroad—**a nonprofit made up of ex-CIA and military personnel** devoted to stopping sex trafficking around the globe. In the five years they’ve been around they’ve saved over 2,500 children’s lives and assisted in the arrest 1,500 sex traffickers.&nbsp;

Sex trafficking is not a far-removed problem from our city, either. San Diego consistently ranks as one of the top 10 cities in the United States with the highest rates of sex trafficking.&nbsp;
